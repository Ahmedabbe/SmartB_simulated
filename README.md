## Background

This project is a sort of proof of concept for creating a hive monitoring system. 

The idea is to give beekeepers more insight into the state of each individual hive while minimizing the need to open said hives up for possibly disruptive manual inspections. This is especially useful in colder places or during harsh winters when opening a hive exposes the bees to potentially lethal temperatures. 

Let's look at what combination of data is relevant for a beekeeper and what information about the hive might be gleaned from said data. 

- Temperature and humidity:  
  Although bees generally don't need help managing the internal temp or humidity of a hive, it's still useful data for figuring out how well a particular colony is         doing. For example, by establishing a baseline temp, a beekeeper can infer about how the queen is faring or if there is enough food by monitoring temperature             fluctuations. Keeping optimal humidity levels equally play an important roll in, amongst other things, honey production and prevention of harmful fungal growths. 
  
- Noise levels:
