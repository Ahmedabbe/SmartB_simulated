# SmartB_simulated

## Overview

### Background

*(This repo is uses simulated data in Node Red)*

This project is a sort of proof of concept for creating a hive management system/tool for personal use. An important side note is that the system/tool is designed for, and eventually tested in, a nordic enviroment. This means warm humid summers and potentially very cold and dry winters.

The idea is to give beekeepers more insight into the state of each individual hive while minimizing the need to open said hives up for possibly disruptive manual inspections. This is especially useful in colder places or during harsh winters when opening a hive exposes the bees to potentially lethal temperatures. 

Let us look at what combination of data is relevant for a beekeeper and what information about the hive might be gleaned from said data. 

#### - Temperature:  
  Although bees generally don't need help managing the internal temp of a hive, it's still useful data for figuring out how well a particular colony is functioning. For
  example, by establishing a baseline temp, a beekeeper can infer about how the queen is fairing or if there is enough food by look at temperature fluctuations.
  
- Humidity:
